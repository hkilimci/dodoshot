## About

DodoShot is a lightweight, native macOS screenshot application built with SwiftUI. Inspired by CleanShot X, it provides a beautiful and intuitive interface for capturing, annotating, and managing screenshots — completely free and open source.

## Features

### Capture modes
- **Area capture** — Select any region of your screen
- **Window capture** — Capture specific application windows
- **Fullscreen capture** — Capture your entire screen
- **Scrolling capture** — Capture long pages by automatically scrolling and stitching

### Quick overlay
- Compact corner overlay appears after capture for immediate actions
- Auto-dismiss with configurable timeout (pauses on hover)
- Drag-and-drop thumbnail directly into other apps
- Quick actions: copy, save, annotate, pin
- Swipe to dismiss
- Stacking overlays for multiple captures

### Floating screenshots
- Pin any screenshot as an always-on-top floating window
- Adjustable opacity for reference images
- Click-through mode — interact with apps beneath the screenshot
- Resize and reposition freely
- Persists across app switches and spaces

### Annotation tools
- **Arrows, rectangles, ellipses, and lines** — Basic shapes
- **Text annotations** — Add labels and notes
- **Callouts** — Speech bubble annotations with customizable arrow direction
- **Blur** — Obscure sensitive information
- **Pixelate** — Privacy redaction with adjustable intensity
- **Highlight** — Draw attention to important content
- **Freehand drawing** — Sketch freely
- **Step counters** — Numbered markers for tutorials (supports 1,2,3 / A,B,C / I,II,III formats)
- **Eraser** — Remove parts of annotations
- **Color picker** — 9 preset colors plus on-canvas color sampling
- **Adjustable stroke width** — Fine-tune line thickness
- **Layer management** — Bring forward, send backward, arrange z-order

### Annotation selection and movement
- Select any annotation to modify it
- Drag to reposition annotations
- Change color or stroke width of selected annotations
- Delete selected annotations

### Measurement tools
- Pixel ruler for measuring on-screen elements
- Color picker to sample any color on screen with hex code copy

### Productivity features
- Auto-copy to clipboard after capture
- Capture history with grid/list views
- Hide desktop icons during capture
- Global keyboard shortcuts
- Customizable backdrop behind screenshots in editor

### AI-powered
- **OCR text extraction** — Extract text from screenshots using Apple's Vision framework (no API key required)

### Privacy
- **No telemetry or analytics** — Your data stays on your device
- No network requests except for optional AI features (when API key is configured)
- Screenshots are stored locally only

### Design
- Native macOS look and feel
- Dark mode support (System/Light/Dark)
- Vibrancy and blur effects
- Smooth animations throughout

## Installation

### Requirements
- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Screen Recording permission
- Accessibility permission (for global hotkeys)

### Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
brew tap DodoApps/tap
brew install --cask dodoshot
xattr -cr /Applications/DodoShot.app
```

> **Note:** The `xattr` command removes the quarantine flag. This is required because the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate.

### Download DMG
1. Download the latest DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/DodoApps/dodoshot/releases)
2. Open the DMG and drag DodoShot to Applications
3. **Important:** Run this command in Terminal to remove the quarantine flag:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr /Applications/DodoShot.app
   ```
4. Launch DodoShot from Applications

> **Note:** The `xattr` command is required because the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate. This is safe for open-source software where you can verify the source code.

### Build from source
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DodoApps/dodoshot.git
   cd dodoshot/DodoShot
   ```

2. Open in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open DodoShot.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run (⌘R)

## Usage

1. Launch DodoShot — it runs in your menu bar
2. Click the menu bar icon or use keyboard shortcuts
3. Select a capture mode
4. After capture, use the quick overlay to:
   - Copy to clipboard
   - Save to file
   - Open annotation editor
   - Pin as floating window
   - Drag thumbnail to other apps
5. Access capture history from the menu bar

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Default shortcut |
|--------|-----------------|
| Area capture | ⌘⇧4 |
| Window capture | ⌘⇧5 |
| Fullscreen capture | ⌘⇧3 |

Shortcuts can be customized in Settings → Hotkeys.
